# CemetechPreMid

## How to install
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/KnightsWhoSayNi0/CemetechPreMid/releases).
2. Place the *dist* folder where you'll remember it.
3. Open the PreMID extension and press *SHIFT*.
4. Click on *Load Presence*.
5. Locate and select the *dist* folder.

Sadly, PreMID currently doesn't have a way to fully install a presence.
So everytime you close your browser you have to reload it. :(
